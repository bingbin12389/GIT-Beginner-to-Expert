# Git Introduction

Git is a free and open-source version control system that allows developers to track changes made to their code, 
collaborate with others, and maintain different versions of their project. 
It's a powerful tool that has become an essential part of modern software development.

# Key Features of Git:

### Version Control: Git allows you to track changes made to your code over time, so you can easily revert to previous versions if needed.
### Distributed System: Git is a decentralized system, meaning that every developer working on a project has a local copy of the entire project history, making it easy to collaborate with others.
### Branching and Merging: Git allows you to create separate branches for different features or versions of your project, making it easy to experiment and merge changes later.
### Security: Git provides a secure way to collaborate with others, using cryptographic techniques to ensure the integrity of your code.

# Basic Git Concepts:

### Repository (Repo): The central location where all your project files are stored.
### Commit: A snapshot of your project at a particular point in time, including changes made since the last commit.
### Branch: A separate line of development in your project, allowing you to work on new features or versions independently.
### Merge: The process of combining changes from two or more branches into a single branch.

# Common Git Commands:

'git init: Initializes a new Git repository in your current directory.
'git add <file>: Stages a file for the next commit.
'git commit -m "<message>": Creates a new commit with a meaningful message.
'git branch <branch-name>: Creates a new branch.
'git checkout <branch-name>: Switches to a different branch.
'git merge <branch-name>: Merges changes from another branch into your current branch.
